This code implements a ROS node that can be used to bridge between ROS and the car racing software published as part of SIG EVO's annual car racing competitions (http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2011/competitions.html)

It republishes the CarState data as RosMessages. It converts CarState messages to TF, Odometry and LaserScan Messages.  It receives CarCommand messages. 

It does not republish the focus sensor or the opponent sensors, but I think this node could be a extended pretty easily to support this. 

As it stands, it supports sufficient interfaces to re-implement the SimpleDriver (see the simpledriver) behaviours as a Ros Node, and to use rviz and the other ROS tools to record, playback, map and visualize the sensor data.
